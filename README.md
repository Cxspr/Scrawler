# Scrawler
Scrawler is app designed to allow you to finally become good at your favorite drawing games thorugh the power of... Cheating! I designed the app with the intent of having it support a wide variety of games and apps. From MSPaint, to Gartic Phone, to drawing games in Jackbox party packs, the app should (in theory) be able to support them all through either the custom game options or by explicitly defining new game definitions within the 'Scrawler.py' file.

## Download
You can download the app from here: https://github.com/cxspr/Scrawler/releases

## Install and Use
After downloading the release, simply unzip the folder and run the .exe file. Once open there are a few steps that need to be done before you can start the Scrawler. First you'll have to select a game or the custom option from the dropdown. After that you'll need to calibrate both the color options and the drawing area. Finally you'll need to add an image by dragging and dropping one from either the internet or from your computer's files and hit generate to convert the image for the Scrawler.
